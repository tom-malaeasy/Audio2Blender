Audio2Blender Addon allows you to sample any audio source on your computer and send the data in real time to Blender Geometry Nodes.

You can sample a microphone or any external sound device and obtain float values for animation and simulation.

There are two types of sampling modes: Volume or FFT (Linear + Logarithmic).
In Volume mode, you get a single float value.
In FFT mode, you get a series of values based on the number of bands within a specified frequency range.

In order to install Audio2Blender you need sounddevice, a python library.

I'm using Blender Pip (Python Module Manager) for codeless installation.

Audio2Blender Addon It's a tool I created for myself. I hope it can be useful to others as well!

‚ö†Ô∏è Audio2Blender seems not to overload the system, but it's still beta/experimental software ‚Äî so be kind to your machine and keep an eye on performance.

I'd love to hear about your experience and suggestions, please share your feedback in the YouTube comments!
